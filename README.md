Algerian Forest Fires Prediction - Regressions


## Problem statement
The problem we aim to solve here is predicting the Fire Weather Index (FWI) for the Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes regions in Algeria. The FWI is an important measure of fire danger, which indicates the likelihood of forest fires based on weather conditions. By using regression algorithms, we want to build a mathematical model that can understand how different weather factors (like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rain) and FWI components (FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI) influence the FWI.

To achieve this, we will use the available historical data to train the regression models. This data contains information about weather conditions and corresponding FWI values for various days from June to September in 2012. Once the models are trained, we can use them to make predictions about the FWI for future dates based on the expected weather conditions.

The ultimate aim is to have accurate models that can help us predict the Fire Weather Index, which can be valuable for fire management and prevention strategies in these regions of Algeria.

## Dataset information
The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

122 instances for each region.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class) The 244 instances have been classified into fire(138 classes) and not fire (106 classes) classes.

Dataset columns:

**Date** : (DD/MM/YYYY) Day, month ('june' to 'september'), year (2012) Weather data observations

**Temp** : temperature noon (temperature max) in Celsius degrees: 22 to 42

**RH** : Relative Humidity in %: 21 to 90

**Ws** :Wind speed in km/h: 6 to 29

**Rain**: total day in mm: 0 to 16.8 FWI Components

**Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC)** index from the FWI system: 28.6 to 92.5

**Duff Moisture Code (DMC)** index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 65.9

**Drought Code (DC)** index from the FWI system: 7 to 220.4

**Initial Spread Index (ISI)** index from the FWI system: 0 to 18.5

**Buildup Index (BUI)** index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 68

**Fire Weather Index (FWI)** Index: 0 to 31.1

**Classes**: two classes, namely Fire and not Fire

## Regression
Regression is a valuable and widely used tool in the world of data science and machine learning. It empowers us to explore and predict the connections between multiple factors. In simpler terms, regression allows us to uncover a mathematical equation that links one factor (the thing we want to figure out) with one or more other factors (the things we think influence it).

Think about having a bag full of various fruits, and you're curious about how the weight of a fruit is related to its size. With regression, you can discover a formula that explains how the weight changes when the size varies. This formula becomes your guide for making predictions about a fruit's weight based on its size. In essence, regression helps us unravel the mysteries hidden within our data and make informed forecasts.



## The Importance of Regression Analysis

Imagine you're in a neighborhood where you know the prices of houses, and you're eyeing a new house. You're curious about how much that house should cost based on its characteristics like size, the number of rooms, and where it's located. That's where regression comes into play. It's like having a crystal ball that can predict the house's price for you.

But regression isn't just for house hunting; it's a powerful tool for uncovering connections between things. Let's say you're a student wondering if the time you spend studying has a real impact on your exam scores. Regression can dig into your study habits and show you if there's a strong link between hitting the books and acing those tests.

In the real world, things get complicated. There are tons of variables at play, and it's not always clear which ones truly matter. Regression helps cut through the confusion. It's like being a detective, finding the important clues in a sea of information. It helps businesses, like your favorite store, predict how much of a product they'll need so you never run out of your must-haves.

In a nutshell, regression is your trusty sidekick when you want to understand how things are connected, make predictions, and make smart decisions based on data. It's the tool that guides you through the maze of information in our data-driven world.

In summary, regression is a valuable tool for
1. **Prediction:** Let's say you have information about the price of houses in a neighborhood and want to know the price of a new house. Regression helps you make a prediction based on the features of the new house, such as its size, number of rooms, and location.
2. **Understanding Relationships :** Regression helps us understand how different factors influence each other. For example, you might want to know how the amount of time spent studying affects exam scores. Regression can show you if there is a strong relationship between study time and scores.
3. **Identifying Important Factors:** In complex situations with many variables, regression helps us figure out which factors have a significant impact on the outcome. It helps us separate the essential factors from the ones that don't matter much.
4. **Decision Making:** Organizations and businesses use regression to make informed decisions. For instance, a company might use regression to predict customer demand for a product, helping them plan their production and inventory efficiently.

Regression is a valuable tool for understanding relationships between variables and making predictions. Its need arises whenever we want to understand, predict, or make decisions based on data and the relationships between different factors.
